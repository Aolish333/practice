\noindent In the first stage, forecasting trends of global languages takes two aspects into account: the change in the total number of people in a particular language and the geographical distribution of the language. For the former, a non-equidistant gray prediction model based on historical data is established under the assumption that there is no sudden change in the number of language speakers in a region.The model gives the number of speakers of the language (ranked in the top twenty).For the latter, we consider the language speakers' geographic distribution.At this time, the influence of the regional population growth and population migration on the shift is taken into account. By applying these two models, we can obtain the change of the total number of speakers of the mainstream languages in the world(Shown in Fig.1), the variations of the number of native speakers in the mainstream languages(Shown in Fig.2),languages of top ten(both native speakers and total speakers) and their ranks in fifty year(see table3).Additionally, we find none of the top ten languages of both native speakers and total speakers is replaced in fifty years and English becomes the most spoken language by the year 2045 with a total population of 1,432.163 million.As for geographical distribution of language speakers, we obtain that Arabic speakers in Africa account for 50.13\% of the total Arabic speaker in 2048.,which indicates geographical distribution of Arabic speakers skews toward Africa.
\par In the second stage:,a language performance evaluation model (LII model) is proposed to determine the location of the new international offices. The LII model considers the specific 15 indicators of a language group in five major categories.Based on the LII model,languages are given performance scores and ranked, from which we find that there is no change in the categories of the top 6 languages in terms of short-term or long-term. Taking into account the language performance is a key factor in site selection so six new offices are located: London, Paris,  Madrid, Dammam, Moscow, Berlin. Finally,we we propose to reduce the number of offices in developed regions based the additional information.
\par Remarkably,we test the model. We conduct a sensitivity analysis of the weights of the LII model indicators.When the weight matrix is corrected by $\omega $=\\(0.225,0.225,0.225,0.225,0.1) to ${\omega _1}$=(0.,0.267,0.267,0.267,0.1) , the rank of the language rankings does not exceed one order of magnitude.
