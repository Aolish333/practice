\noindent If an alien came after 50 years, what language should it learn to understand human civilization more fully? The research findings in this article can give an answer.
\par In this article, we predict trends in the mainstream languages of the world today and determine the address of a new international office for a multinational corporation.
\par The first stage: from the total number of language population and geographical distribution of language to predict the trend of global language development.For the former, we assume that there is no sudden factor to change the number of language speakers in a certain region drastically. Since there is a missing value in the collected data, a non-equidistant GM (1,1) prediction model is established to predict the total number of language speakers.Then analyses the trend of the total population in the first 20 languages.For the latter, consider the impact of the two factors of geographical population growth and population migration on geographical distribution of languages. 
\par The second stage: the establishment of language performance evaluation model (LII model) to determine the location of the new international offices.The LII model considers the specific 15 indicators of a language group in five major areas: Area, Economic strength, Language speakers, Knowledge and communication, International use. Firstly the indicator value is quantified to [0, 1], then weighted to obtain the language performance score and ranked.Analyze change of rankings of language performance score every 10 years in the future, and find that there is no change in the categories of the top 6 languages in terms of short-term or long-term.We assume that the offices are usually established in the capital of the country where the first language is the mother tongue, so six new offices are located: London, England / Paris, France / Madrid, Spain / Dammam, Saudi Arabia / Moscow, Russia / Berlin, Germany.Finally, considering the nature of the change in the global communications (geographically distant Internet connections and language barrier with powerful translation software), we think it is possible to set up an international office in each continent, that is, in addition to the United States and China , Confirming the establishment of four more new international offices.
