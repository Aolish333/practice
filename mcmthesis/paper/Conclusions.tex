\section{Conclusions}
According to our model, the trend of language development can be reflected in two aspects: the number of language speakers and the regional differences in languages.The location of the new international office is based on the key factors: the effectiveness of the language.
\par In the part of prediction of the trend of languages,we can obtain the change of the total number of speakers of the mainstream languages in the world(Shown in Fig.1), the variations of the number of native speakers in the mainstream languages(Shown in Fig.2),languages of top ten(both native speakers and total speakers) and their ranks in fifty years(see table3).What's more, We find that ranked currently in the top ten languages in the future rankings remain in the top ten, but the specific rankings changethe total number of speakers of English exceeds the number of speakers of Chinese in 2045, when the total population of the former reach 1,432.163 million.As for the part of geographical distribution of language speakers, we obtain that the Arabic speakers account for 50.13\% of the total Arabic speaker in 2048.Additionally, the most powerful growth is in Spanish.
\par In the part of siting in international offices,we build an evaluation model of language effectiveness. Based on this model, we examine the effectivenesse of the mainstream language over time. Further, we determine the language zones to be selected for the new international office based on the performance ranking of the language.Based on the results of our modeling, we find no significant differences in the rankings of language performance in the short term and long term,so there is no change in the construction plan for the new office.When we assume that we can capture the penetration of regional Internet and that the multinational companies have web services.We obtain the higher the Internet penetration rate in a given area, the lower the need to have an office there.Therefore, we propose to reduce the number of offices in developed regions and consider setting up offices in areas with great potential such a some areas of Africa
