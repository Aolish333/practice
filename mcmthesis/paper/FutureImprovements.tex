\section{Future Improvements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Since we did not fully consider the background factors given in the subject when we set up the forecasting model, we only make a prediction based on the data of the linguistic population itself, and the error between this forecast and the actual situation is relatively large. The main reason is that less than the relevant data cannot be collected. If we can get the historical data of 5-10 years from the relevant factors and we can correct the predicted values through the relevant factor analysis, then the result of our model will be more accurate.\\
\item For the change of linguistic population on geographical distribution, we may have some limitations to simplify the analysis and to study only the changes of the net migration population under the research of the state. We believe that we can also analyze the language flow direction from the discrepancy or gravity of any two languages to establish the "language distance" model or the gravity model. Thus, we can draw a directed graph of geographical distribution of the number of second-language mainstream in the world and more vividly analyze the impact of the mode of population migration on geographical distribution of languages.
